First step is to create the files for a basic web API project that uses controllers, along with a C# project file named IoTStorage.csproj that will return a list of weather forecasts. To do this we run the line : dotnet new webapi -f net6.0
After Line hase been run in the terminal the following files will be availble:
-| Controllers //(Contains classes with public methods exposed as HTTP endpoints)
-| obj  
-| Properties
-| appsettings.Development.json
-| appsettings.json
-| IoTStorage.csproj   //(Contains configuration metadata for the project)
-| Program.cs  //(Configures services and the app's HTTP request pipeline, and contains the app's managed entry point)
-| WeatherForecast.cs
