# Description
For project 2 we hade to create repository on Github. This repo contains a file that has link to my Azure files.
 The fowllowing links were:
 1. The Database: project2DB
 2. Server: project2db
 3. API Managment Serveice: IoTdata.
 After that the Database with the three requierds tabels were created in SSMS. I also linked the SSMS with my Visual Studio folder with a conncetion string. In the VC file I had to scaffold the database inorder to create controllers for each data base. After words I had to implemented the methods PUT, GET, POST, DELETE  as functionalities for the API. Last stemp I had to do in VC file was Publishing the file in swagger.
 For the Last step it was neccesary to post it onto the cloud and adding security.

## Server details
Name: prject2dbs

## Connection string
I was unable to connect VC with ssms, because VC could not find the project. My ssms project work 100%, but I dont know why VC was not able to fine the project.
